# Binary file reverser

## Usage
Byte-by-byte, a binary input file is expanded into a binary output file. 
If the output file does not exist, or the path to it does not exist, 
but can be created, it tries to create it.

## Jar application
There is also a jar application in the repository that performs the same functionality, and which can be launched using the command:
```
java -jar reverser.jar <input file> <output file>
```
